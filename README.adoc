Asciidoctor Reducer is a tool that reduces an AsciiDoc document with includes into a single document by expanding all includes reachable from the specified parent document.
If the document does not contain any includes, it returns the original source.

IMPORTANT: This project is still in prototype.
As such, there is no release available.
